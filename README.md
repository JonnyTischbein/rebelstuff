# RebelStuff - Keep track of your stuff

It's hard to keep track of your stuff.
Especially if you have a lot of it.
Even more so if you tend to lend it to other people.

RebelStuff allows you to keep track of â€¦

-   your stuff
-   who you lent it to
-   when it should be returned
-   what is still available

## Quickstart

```
make
```

Simple as that.

This will also create three users: "admin", "stuffer", and "booker". All with
password "password".

## Deployment

This is a django project, so you should consult the [django
docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/howto/deployment/).
